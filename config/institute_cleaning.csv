#Manually made lookup from author provided info to the canonical institute name.,
#The order matters here, the matching starts at the top of the list and stops when something is found.
#Ignore The, so The University of Bristol is University of Bristol.
#Group alphabetically by the main name, so all variations of Bristol should be in B.
#,
#Do email addresses first - they are much more structured than postal addresses, and usually people have one.
